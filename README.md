# Typing

## Typing Lessons

I feel the need to learn to type. Sites such as [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) seem to be the go to recommendation. It's algorithmic approach didn't feel right to me. Maybe this is because I'm old enough to remember typing lessions in the 80s which emphasized a lot of drills consisting of repetitive keystrokes.

So, I am proceeding with [gtypist](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gtypist/gtypist.html).

On Ubuntu this can be installed with:

```
sudo apt install gtypist
```
I find that it helps to increase the size of the terminal (in the one I am using this is done with `Ctrl + +`. I did that 4 times. Doing it 5 times makes gtypist barf out.

## Included Drills

I'm starting with the default gtypist drills. Not sure if I will continue with them.

Gtypist includes drills from [KTouch](https://apps.kde.org/ktouch/) 1.6.

Run the English drill like this:

```
gtypist kten.typ
```

## Custom Drills

Eventually, I will include some custom drills for gtypist using ChatGPT. Haven't figured out the correct syntax yet.
