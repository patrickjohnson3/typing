# Typing

## Typing Lessons

I feel the need to learn to type. Sites such as [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) seem to be the go to recommendation. It's algorithmic approach didn't feel right to me. Maybe this is because I'm old enough to remember typing lessions in the 80s which emphasized a lot of drills consisting of repetetive keystrokes.

So, I am proceeding with [gtypist](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gtypist/gtypist.html).

On Ubuntu this can be installed with:

```
sudo apt install gtypist
```

I find that it helps to increase the size of the terminal (in then one I am using is done with `Ctrl + +`. I did that 4 times. Doing it 5 times makes gtypist barf out.

## Custom Drills

Eventually, I will include some custom drills for gytypist using ChatGPT. Haven't figured out the correct syntax yet.
